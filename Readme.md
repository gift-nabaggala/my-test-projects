 * Each main folder in this project contains its own `test` folder with relevant test files.
 * To run the tests for a specific module:
 * 1. Open your terminal.
 * 2. Change directory (`cd`) into the desired folder.
 * 3. Run `npm test` to execute the tests for that module.
 *
 * Repeat these steps for each folder you wish to test.
