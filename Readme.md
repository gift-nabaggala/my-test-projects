## How to Navigate and Run Tests

Each main folder in this project contains its own `test` folder with relevant test files.

1.  Open your terminal.
2.  Change directory (`cd`) into the desired folder.
3.  Run `npm test` to execute the tests for that module.

Repeat these steps for each folder you wish to test.
